# Extension Configuration

Starting with version `0.4.0`, various aspects of this extension can be configured. You can configure such aspects by adding configuration settings to your `settings.json`

```
"map.preview.projections": [
    { "epsgCode": 28355, "definition": "+proj=utm +zone=55 +south +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs" }

]
```

## map.preview.declutterLabels

Type: `boolean`

Default Value: `false`

Description: If set to `true`, the preview vector layer will have decluttering enabled, which will prevent rendering of features whose labels overlap with others. This is useful for data like point-heavy KML files where the point density is such that labels are illegible at the higher zoom levels, but as you zoom in closer, more points and labels are able to be shown.
